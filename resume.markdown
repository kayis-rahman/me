# 💼 Kayis Rahman – Resume

Welcome! I'm **Kayis Rahman**, a **Software Engineer**, **Cloud Enthusiast**, and **Tech Leader** with a passion for crafting clean code, scalable systems, and beautiful backend architecture. With over **9 years** of professional experience, I’ve delivered high-impact solutions across diverse domains.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a backend-focused developer currently based in **Dublin**, Ireland, with a solid foundation in **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and microservices architecture. My professional journey has taken me through exciting challenges—leading engineering teams, deploying Kubernetes clusters, automating CI/CD pipelines, and optimizing performance in cloud-native applications.

I’m driven by curiosity and a love for problem-solving. Whether it's redesigning a legacy email system to slash costs and boost performance or mentoring junior developers over coffee, I always aim for solutions that balance practicality and elegance.

💡 **Current Focus**:
- Backend Engineering (Java, Spring Boot)
- Cloud Platforms (AWS, Google Cloud)
- DevOps & Automation (Docker, Kubernetes, GitLab CI)
- Microservices & Scalable Architecture

📌 **Goal**: Open to **remote**, **freelance**, or **part-time roles** — especially ones in **Java** and **Cloud** technologies where I can make a real impact.
