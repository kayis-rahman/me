A passionate **Software Engineer**, **Cloud Enthusiast**, and **Tech Leader** with over **9 years of experience** building scalable, reliable, and efficient solutions. I specialize in backend-heavy development using **Java** and **Spring Boot**, but I also enjoy diving into cloud ecosystems like **AWS** and **Google Cloud**. From leading cross-functional teams to architecting microservices, I bring both technical depth and collaborative spirit to the table.

Currently based in **Dublin**, I thrive at the intersection of clean code, creative problem-solving, and continuous improvement. I’ve worked on everything from high-performance APIs to Kubernetes deployments and CI/CD pipelines. I’m the kind of developer who gets excited by elegant solutions and new challenges — whether it’s optimizing performance or mentoring junior devs over a good cup of coffee ☕.

I’m currently open to **remote**, **freelance**, or **part-time roles** where I can contribute to meaningful projects in **Java**, **cloud infrastructure**, and beyond. If you're looking for someone who’s technically sharp, people-friendly, and always curious — let’s build something impactful together.
